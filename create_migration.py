To apply this migration, follow these steps:

1. Create a feature branch with the migration folder name as the branch name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b {folder_name}
   ```

2. Add only the migration folder that was created to the commit:
    ```bash
    git add migrations/{folder_name}git add migrations/{folder_name}
    ```

3. Commit the changes with the description as the commit message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "{description}"
    ```

4. Push the commit to the remote repository named origin:
    ```bash
    git push origin {folder_name}git push origin {folder_name}
    ```

5. Create a pull request and wait for it to be approved and merged into the main branch.

6. After the pull request is merged, you can delete the local and remote feature branches:
    ```bash
    git branch -d {folder_name}git branch -d {folder_name}
    git push origin --delete {folder_name}

    readme_file.write(readme_content)

cursor.close()
conn.close()
